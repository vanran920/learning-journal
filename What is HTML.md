HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and it’s the foundational language used to create and structure content on the web. Think of it as the skeleton of every webpage—it tells the browser what to display and how to organize it.
**Example**
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, Vansh!</h1>
    <p>This is your first HTML paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
