Semantic HTML elements are tags that clearly describe their meaning and purposeâ€”both to the browser and to developers. Instead of just organizing content visually, they give contextual meaning to the structure of a webpage, which improves accessibility, SEO, and maintainability.



ðŸ§  Why Semantic Elements Matter
Accessibility: Screen readers can better interpret content.

SEO: Search engines understand your page structure more easily.

Readability: Your code becomes easier to understand and maintain.

Best Practice: Encouraged in modern web development and HTML5.
